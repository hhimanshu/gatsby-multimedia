We will try to put as much information about what is possible here in this markdown. Let's get started! 

A lot of this has been learned from [here](https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/hello-world-kitchen-sink/)

## List
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item  
    * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number (in source code it is 1.)
    1. Ordered sub-list 1
    2. Ordered sub-list 2  
    1. Ordered sub-list 3
4. And another item (paragraph).

    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

    To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
    
Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
* Unordered list can use asterisks  
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
